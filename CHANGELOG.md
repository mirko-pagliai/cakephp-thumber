* the name of the thumbnails (when automatically generated) now contains a
    prefix with the checksum of the path of the original image and a suffix with

    prefix of a thumbnail, it will be possible to identify the original image
    from which it was generated;

    date and time at which the thumbnail file was modified for the last time;

    this method can be used in different contexts.
