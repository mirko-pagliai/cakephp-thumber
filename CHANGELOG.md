### 1.8.0
* much of the code will be moved into the `php-thumber` package, so that it

    include the code closely related to CakePHP (commands, helpers, middlewares, etc);
* the namespace prefix is now `Thumber\Cake` and no longer `Thumber`;
* the `ThumbsPathTrait` no longer exists. The `getPath()` method no longer
    exists, use instead the `THUMBER_TARGET` constant. The `resolveFilePath()`

### 1.7.1
* renamed commands. Now they are `thumber.clear` and `thumber.clear_all`;
* requires `me-tools` package for dev;
* removed `ConsoleIntegrationTestTrait`, because it is now sufficient to use the
    same trait provided by `me-tools`;
* updated for CakePHP 3.7.1 and `php-tools` 1.1.12;
* added [API](//mirko-pagliai.github.io/cakephp-thumber).

### 1.7.0

## 1.6 branch
### 1.6.1
* added `ConsoleIntegrationTestCase` class;
* updated for CakePHP 3.7.

### 1.6.0

    "serve" thumbnails. The `ThumbsController` has therefore been deleted;
* updated for CakePHP 3.6 and 3.7;
* fixed little bug for PHP 5.6.

## 1.5 branch
### 1.5.2
* fixed little bug for PHP 5.6.

### 1.5.1
* added `ThumbCreator::getUrl()` method;
* added `getThumbCreatorInstance()` and `getThumbCreatorInstanceWithSave()`
    methods to the `Thumber\TestSuite\TestCase` class. This simplifies tests.

* added `TestCase::skipIfDriverIs()` method;
* `ThumbTrait` becomes `ThumbsPathTrait` and it has no more `getDriver()`,
    `getExtension()` and `getUrl()` methods;
* the `ThumbCreator::getDefaultSaveOptions()` method now can take the `$path`
    optional argument;
* removed `ThumbTrait::getSupportedFormats()` method, added
    `ThumbManager::$supportedFormats` static property;
* `InternalErrorException` exception has been replaced with `RuntimeException`.

## 1.4 branch
### 1.4.1
* `ThumbNotFoundException` extends the `RuntimeException` and now is located
    below the `Thumber\Http\Exception` namespace. This ensures compability with
    CakePHP 3.6.
* removed `assertFileExtension()`, `assertImageSize()` and `assertMime()`
    methods provided by `Thumber\TestSuite\TestCase` class.

### 1.4.0
* removed all methods provided previously by the `ThumbHelper`. These methods
    are now called dynamically by the `__call()` magic method;
* tests have been simplified. The library to be tested is set by the
    `tests/bootstrap.php` file, using the `THUMBER_DRIVER` environment variable.
    By default, Imagick is used;
* full support for Windows, added tests for Appveyor;
* added `Thumber\TestSuite\TestCase::assertThumbUrl()` method;
* now it uses the `mirko-pagliai/php-tools` package. This also replaces
    `mirko-pagliai/reflection`.

### 1.3.1
* added `ThumbCreator::resizeCanvas()` method;
* added `ThumbHelper::resizeCanvas()` and `ThumbHelper::resizeCanvasUrl()` methods.

### 1.3.0
* the name of the thumbnails (when automatically generated) now contains a
    prefix with the checksum of the path of the original image and a suffix with
    the checksum of all the arguments used to create the thumbnail. Using the
    prefix of a thumbnail, it will be possible to identify the original image
    from which it was generated;
* the `Last-Modified` header is set up and sent to the client. It indicates the
    date and time at which the thumbnail file was modified for the last time;
* added `ThumbManager` and `ThumbShell` classes;
* `resolveFilePath()` method moved from `ThumbCreator` to `ThumbTrait`, because
    this method can be used in different contexts.

## 1.2 branch
### 1.2.0
* updated for intervention/image 2.4;
* some little fixes. This package requires at least CakePHP 3.4.

* added `rtr()` global function;
* added `THUMBER` constant.
